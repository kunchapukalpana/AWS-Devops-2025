Scenario-Based Linux Interview Questions for DevOps Engineers

1. Troubleshooting Services:* 
 • Scenario : Your application is running on an Apache web server, but the website is not accessible. What steps would you take to identify and resolve the issue?

2. Disk Space Management* :
 • Scenario : You receive an alert that a production server is running low on disk space. How would you identify the files or directories consuming the most space and clean it up safely?

3. Process Monitoring and Optimization:* 
 • Scenario : A server is experiencing high CPU usage, and the application performance is degraded. How would you identify the root cause and optimize the processes?

4. User Management and Permissions:* 
 • Scenario : A user is unable to access a specific directory even though they belong to the correct group. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this permission issue?

5. Network Connectivity Issues:* 
 • Scenario : Your server is unable to reach a specific external IP address. What steps would you take to diagnose and resolve this network connectivity issue?

6. File Recovery* :
 • Scenario : An important configuration file has been accidentally deleted. How would you attempt to recover this file if there are no backups?

7. Automating Tasks with Shell Scripts:* 
 • Scenario : You need to automate the deployment of an application. How would you use shell scripting to automate the process, including stopping services, copying files, and restarting services?

8. Log Analysis:* 
• Scenario : An application is intermittently failing. How would you use Linux command-line tools to analyze logs and identify the root cause of these failures?

9. Service Start-Up Failure:* 
 • Scenario : A critical service fails to start after a server reboot. How would you diagnose and resolve the startup failure?

10. Kernel Tuning and Optimization* :
 • Scenario : You need to optimize the server’s performance for a high-traffic application. How would you tune kernel parameters to improve system performance?

11. Managing Crontab Entries:* 
 • Scenario : A scheduled cron job did not execute as expected. How would you troubleshoot this issue and ensure the job runs correctly in the future?

12. Handling Large File Transfers:* 
• Scenario : You need to transfer a large file securely from one server to another. What methods would you use to ensure the transfer is efficient and secure?

13. Deploying Updates with Zero Downtime* :
• Scenario : You need to deploy updates to an application without causing downtime. How would you achieve this on a Linux server?

14. Managing System Resources* :
• Scenario : The server's memory usage is consistently high, affecting application performance. What steps would you take to identify the cause and manage system resources effectively


Few Scenario Based DevOps interview Questions

1.     You need to deploy a new version of a microservice with minimal downtime, but your Kubernetes cluster is running at full capacity. What steps would you take?
2.     A developer accidentally pushed sensitive AWS credentials into the public GitHub repository. What immediate actions would you take?
3.     Your automated build pipeline in Jenkins occasionally fails due to flaky tests. How would you handle this problem to improve reliability?
4.     You notice high CPU usage on your EC2 instances running containers deployed by ECS. How would you identify and fix the problem?
5.     You want to automate environment setup for development, staging, and production using Infrastructure as Code. How do you structure your Terraform code for reuse and consistency?
6.     You have to roll back a deployment after a failed update in Kubernetes. What strategy would you use, and how would you implement it?
7.     Your Jenkins job triggers on every commit but developers complain it's causing slowdowns. How would you optimize the CI/CD workflow?
8.     Your Docker image size has grown considerably and is slowing down your build and deployment process. What steps would you take to reduce it?
